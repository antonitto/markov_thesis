# Experiment 2

Experiment 2 builds the relationship between the number of migrations and confidence (credibility) interval width.

In files (Experiment 2.1 - Bootstrap)[exp_2_1_bootstrap.R] and (Experiment 2.1 - BMCMC)[exp_2_1_BMCMC.R] we simulate samples of differenet lengths and estimate confidence (credibility) interval widths for each simulated sample.

In file (Experiment 2.2)[exp_2_2_regr.R] we import this data, visualize it and estimate regression coefficients (linear regression after data tranformation, WLS method).
