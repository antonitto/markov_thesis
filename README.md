This repository was created to share the text and all of the materials (scripts, data, etc.) that comprise my Master thesis 'Interval Estimation of Transition Matrices Given Limited Data Sample'. As a result, by running the scripts of the project one might easily replicate (accurate to the seed) the results of the work.

The thesis might be of use for risk analysts and statisticians, since within the paper we test:

* Adequacy and convergence of methods proposed for confidence estimation of Markov chain migration matrices (See [Experiment 1](experiment_1)).
* Build the relationship between the volume of data needed and the 

If you are interest in diving into the experiments carried out in the thesis, please proceed to the [Repository contents](contents.md).

**Warning!** Since the project involves a huge number of simulations, it takes a significant amount of time to carry out the experiments locally. I would personally appreciate if one could optimize the calculations or suggest other ideas for project improvement.

Should you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to contact me at [my e-mail](mailto:markov.anton.a@gmail.com).
