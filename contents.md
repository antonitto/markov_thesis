# Contents of the Git repository

The scripts are organized the following way:

In folder [Experiment 1](experiment_1) you can find scripts required to carry out Experiment 1 of the thesis. Generally, there are 3 subfolders:

* [Experiment 1.1](experiment_1/experiment_1_1), where we test adequacy of Wald, bootstrap, and BMCMC confidence (credibility) intervals;
* [Experiment 1.2](experiment_1/experiment_1_2), where we test the influence of an imbalanced sample on the results;
* [Experiment 1.3](experiment_1/experiment_1_3), where we test if the proposed BMCMC method converges to a stationary distribution;

In folder [Experiment 2](experiment_2) you can find scripts required to carry out [Experiment 2](experiment_2/README.md) of the thesis. Within the experiment we build the dependence between the data volume and interval width.

In folder [Experiment 3](experiment_3) you can find scripts required to carry out Experiment 3 of the thesis.

* [Experiment 3.1](experiment_3/experiment_3_1), where we build confidence intervals for Expected credit loss (ECL) based on confidence intervals for transition matrices;
* [Experiment 3.2](experiment_3/experiment_3_2), where we propose the methodology for optimal choice of input data segmentation.
